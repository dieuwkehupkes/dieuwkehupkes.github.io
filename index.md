My name is Dieuwke Hupkes.
The first question that many people ask me when they meet me is _How do I pronounce your name?_ So, here goes. My (first) name comes from a small province in the north of the Netherlands, called Frisia, where they speak Frisian.
For those that can read it: the phonetic transcription of my name is *dju'k«ù*.
The first part is pronounced more or less exactly as the English word "duke" in British English (d-you-k), the second syllable sounds like "uh". 
The stress is on the first syllable, so altogether: DUKE-uh .
Still difficult? [Listen how I pronounce it myself](https://dieuwkehupkes.nl/audio/DieuwkeHupkes.mp3).<br><br>

Some more info about me: I am currently a research scientist at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/" target="_blank">Meta AI Research</a>.
Before that, I did my PhD at the <a href="https:/illc.uva.nl" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)</font></a>, under supervision of <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/w.zuidema/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Willem Zuidema</font></a>, and a brief postdoc at the <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/" target="_blank">Amsterdam unit</a> of <a href="https://ellis.eu/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">ELLIS</font></a>. 

In my dissertation -- titled [<i>Hierarchy and interpretability in neural models of language processing</i>](https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/48164248/Thesis.pdf){:target="blank"} -- I studied artificial neural networks for natural language processing, with as main aim to understand what they may teach us about processing of structure.
While artificial neural networks are of course far from the real brain, I hope that understanding the principles by which they can encode and process structure can teach us something that will lead to a better understanding of how language is processed by the human brain. 
<br /><br />

Already quite a while ago, I started my journey in academia studying physics.
At some point, I had to admit that although I think physics is very interesting and I love abstract systems, my true passion is really the beautifully complex system that is natural language.
While doing a master in Logic at the University of Amsterdam I was very lucky to discover the field of computational linguistics.
I am still very glad that I got the chance to have a job that allows me to try to find answers to the questions that intrigue me most.
<br /><br />

In my free time, I spend a lot of time training for pole dancing competitions. 
In 2018, I won the national championships in the category doubles.
Curious what it looks like?
