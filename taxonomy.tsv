There are also experiments where the in-context examples are in a different language though, which does not seem to fit our taxonomy very well.

It basically trains several language models in English and Japanese. The authors then evaluate whether the surprisal estimates of better models lead to better predicitons of reading times in Japanese (as has been reported in English). So they investigate whether the psycholinguistic theory generalises across languages, but not the models themselves.
